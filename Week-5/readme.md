## Week 5

This weeks assignment was to create a memory game.

# Workflow
I decided to create a memory game using images from Marvel. Coding wise it was fairly straight forward. I knew I wanted to create this game using a table, which meant I needed to learn about <table> in HTML, which I hadn't really coded with much before.

# Problems
The biggest issue I had this week was accidentally leaving the closing bracket off a function in my main.js file. Which resulted in my images not loading. I am a little embarrassed at how long it took me to realize what the problem was. I definitely learned to check for errors using the "Inspect Element" in Firefox. It helped point me in the right direction and the problem would of been fixed much faster. I was convince I just had the file path incorrect leading to the images, and wasted a lot of time, staring at code that didn't have any problems.
