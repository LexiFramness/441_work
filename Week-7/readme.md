## Week 7

This weeks assignment was to use multiple arrays, and pull one to be displayed randomly. Using a button to cycle through the stored arrays.

# Workflow
I stuck with my Marvel theme from the previous two weeks, and pulled images and information from the website: https://www.imdb.com/ This was just the easiest and fastest way for me to complete this weeks homework assignment with the limited amount of time I had to complete it.

# Problems
The biggest issue I ran into was the size of my images, they force the user to scroll down. Which I am not fond of, but I couldn't get the css set properly this week due to the limited amount of time I left myself to get homework completed this week. I wanted to throw in a cover photo that would appear with the button when you first loaded the index.html, but ran out of time to complete that as well. My problem this week was time management...
