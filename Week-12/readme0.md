# **Final Project:**

## Basic Idea

I wanted to try and create a basic game of pong, with a working counter showing lives remaining, as well as a counter showing points as the player acquires them. The paddle will be attached to the mouse and will be constricted to the lower part of the screen. I want to incorporate some sort of arcade style music in the background as well. I will have to research how to add music to my project. This version will be 1 player, and use the top of the screen to return the ball back towards the players paddle.


## Problems
The first real error I ran into with the project was forgetting to add the p5 sound library to my index.html file. so I couldn't get pass the preload function. Once I figured out that mistake I was able to move forward with the project. Creating a working life or "lives" counter was really hard to do. I also decided to add a reset button so the user could restart the game without refreshing the webpage. I wasn't fond of trying to constrain the mouse to a certain part of the screen, and have it be a paddle.

For the life of me, I could not get the AI paddle to work properly with returning the ball towards the player. In the end, I had to do a work around, which gives the appearance of the AI paddle working properly, but in reality the AI paddle is broken.

# End Product
I was able to get fairly close to what I originally set out to achieve, In order to properly build my site I had to first learn how to properly use the preload function, this allowed me to load up the sound files before the game started, ensuring that the first time the ball hits the paddle, the sound plays properly.  I used the Coding Train on youtube to refresh myself and learn new things required to complete this assignment. I also decided that using the mouse to control the players paddle was a bad idea, and decided to learn how to control the paddle using the arrow keys. Once I learned how to do this, I was able to add it to the project easily.

I also wanted to divide the code up into multiple files to help keep track of the code easier, this proved useful when trying to look at specific pieces of code quickly. Adding the button to reset the game was really easy, I found a nice tutorial over on "The Coding Train's" youtube page.  Overall, I am pretty happy with where my project has ended up.
