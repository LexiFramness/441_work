## Week 13

This week was frustrating for me. I could not think of an idea to use for this weeks homework, so I took what you made for the example, and changed it a little to make it my own. I typed all the code I used myself. I added a restart feature, which takes the players square back to its starting point, and resets the live counter to 3 if the player collides with the stationary squares on the canvas more than 3 times.

# Issues
I struggled to get the lives to stop at 0, show a game over screen, and reset the game. I have done this in projects before, but for some reason it took forever for this project. I was not able to add the "GAME OVER" that I wanted to add.
