## Week 4

This weeks assignment was to continue our choose your own adventure game.

# Workflow
This week I didn't get too crazy with my coding, honestly only because I ran out of time in the week to do much with the assignment, I wanted to rebuild the game to be completely in the web browser, without the use of the pop up prompt windows, but being short on time, I just picked up where I left off on week 3.

# Problems
using my pop up prompt, I was a little lost on getting the game to just start over completely. I am sure if I had left myself more time to complete the homework I would of been able to add that feature to the assignment. Next week I plan to put more time into the weeks coursework/homework assignment.
