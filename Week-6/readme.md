## Week 6

This weeks assignment was to continue building our memory game and add a start page where we recorded the players first name, last name, and age. Additionally we needed to keep track of the number of attempts it took for the player to complete the game.

# Workflow
My workflow was fairly straight forward for this assignment, I needed to add the player, and a counter, along with writing the code to reset the images if they did not match. I also needed to rework the organization of my files. Which created an issue with some file paths. This was a fairly straight forward issue to address, just a little more time consuming than I would have liked. I also decided to turn my "Start Over" Button into a "New Game" Button, which will take you back to the previous webpage.

# Problems
The biggest problem I had with this weeks assignment was forgetting to add the  player(); to my Game() function, so when I left index.html and when to gameMarvel.html the players info was not stored. So upon completing the game, no information about the player was available to be displayed in the win.html file.
