## Week 3

This weeks assignment was to create the beginning of a choose your own adventure game.

# Workflow
This week I didn't get too crazy with my coding, I left it fairly simple, but decided I would add a little css to it, just so the page wasn't white.

# Problems
The biggest issue I had this week was coming up with a game idea to create for this assignment. I am not sure how to change the font in the text box window that pops up, I would like to use the same font I am using on the rest of the html. But I ran out of time to figure that out this week.
