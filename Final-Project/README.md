## Final project
  For my final project, I made a snake game using the p5 library.
  I have done multiple projects in the past using the p5 library, and decided to use it for this final project as well. I used version 0.7.3 of p5, instead of version 0.8.0 because I was running into an issue with using "pos" in my eat.food code that did not exist when using 0.7.3. Since I needed to run a specific version of the p5 library. I decided that I wanted to cache the files locally, and not rely on a could service keeping an old version accessible.

## Issues
I could not get a score counter to work, I could get the text to appear, that was easy, but adding the code to add one to the score when you eat a piece of food kept caused the code to break. I was unable to figure out why this was.

I also tried to add sound but was running into compatibility issues using 0.7.3 p5 preload function. So I had to scrap the background audio.

## Conclusions
Overall I am fairly happy with my final project, I am a little disappointed, I was unable to get the score counter to work properly. But I managed to complete my primary goal, which was create a snake game that reset if the player ran into the snake or walls.
